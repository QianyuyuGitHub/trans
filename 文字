# segmentation In Deep Learning

semantic segmentation: 
labeling every pixel of image and using sliding window/filter to classify single patchse requires tons of effort to do. Breaking image into craps uesd for semantic segmentation is what you could possibly do, but with a corresponding crop to store the labels for every single pixel this will be such a time and storage consuming idea to implement. 
Another idea is to use convolutional neural networks instead of fully connected networks, so that you could rather than extracting individual patches from the image to classify them independently, you may directly send in the whole iamge without worrying about croping issues. But still, the cost of labeling the dataset is way too expensive. Normally it require annotations by people using cortour drawing tools.
To get rid of this issue, we could think over about fully convolutional layers with downsampling and upsampling.

# Image Segmentation

As a fundamental problem set of tremendous science problems, image segmentation always plays a vital role of pretreatment. 

Thresholding:
Thresholding is considered the simplest solution program to it. Basing on a threshold value, turn a gray-scale image into a binary image. And namely, this is called balanced histogram thresholding. The key part is mainly about the choice of threshold value(values with multiple-levels are selected). Such methods could be named: Otsu’s method(maximum variance), and k-means clustering. And recently these methods are developed for thresholding Computed Tomography(CT) images. Mostly it’s thresholds are derived from the radiographs instead of the reconstructed image.
Clustering Methods:
Another inevitably topic is Clustering Methods. It’s a well-applied idea in machine learning progresses. Widely developed and improved. It’s now a classic and useful tool to get the data inner groups separated from each other. It’s also a vital task of data mining and statistical data analysis. Could be used for pattern recognization, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression and computer graphics. Clustering notions includes small distances between cluster members, dense areas of the data space, intervals or particular statistical distributions. Therefore, clustering will be a multi optimization problem. 
There are several clustering algorithms, Connectivity-based clustering is one of the popular, known as hierarchical clustering methods also. Basically the whole idea is base on a determination of distance between samples. So it might be extremely important for users to decide which distance function they should providing. Meanwhile, linkage criterion should be considered as well for there is always more than one objects. (Such as single-linkage clustering(the minimum of object distance), complete linkage clustering(the maximum of object distance) and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean). More sophisticatedly speaking, hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative(begining with single elements and aggregating them into clusters) or divisive(starting with the complete data set and dividing it into partitions ). Centroid-based clustering is another remarkable one. And a particularly approximate method is Lloyd’s algorithm(k-means) for the original problem itself will be NP hard. K-means is a widely used algorithm. It has some loose relationship to the k-nearest neighbor classifier. In short, the aim is to find the minimal within-cluster sum of squares through derivations.
Distribution-Based clustering is another kind of clustering algorithm. Literally, it's based on distribution models. Take Expectation-Maximization(EM) clustering algorithm as an prominent example, it's the background algorithm that Gaussian Misture models use. In Gaussian Misture model, EM method will iteratively get closer to the target set, but instead, how to choose the complexity is inherently difficult.
Density-Based clustering is also a astonishing clustering algorithm. The most popular one may be Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise(DBSCAN). Similar to linkage based clustering, it will connect points within certain distance thresholds. Clusters are defined as higher density areas than the remainders. This method is lacking ability to precisely devide the clusters comparing to the OPTICS method.
Compression-Based Methods
Compression based methods postulate the optimal segmentation is the one to minimize the coding length of the data.
