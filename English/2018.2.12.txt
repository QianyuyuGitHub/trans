# Captain Brown Pants Joke

A British Navy frigate in the Age of Exploration is tasked with hunting pirates in the Carribean. A veteran captain and a fresh crew are assigned to the vessel. Not long after being dispatched, the ship encounters a small pirate sloop. The crew is nervous about their first fight but their captain is steadfast.

"All hands on deck! Man the guns and load chain shot! Full sails!" The captain roars. "And bring me my red shirt!"

The crew is perplexed by the last order but comply quickly. The captain dons his shirt and is the first to board the enemy vessel as they close, brandishing his cutlass with fury. It's an overwhelming victory for the Navy ship and the crew are ecstatic.

A few days later the crew spot another, but much larger pirate ship. Their confidence bolstered by the last victory, the crew ready themselves for another battle.

"All hands on deck! Man the guns and load chain shot! Full sails! And bring me my red shirt!"

The crew scramble and again the captain is the first to charge headlong onto the pirate ship, cutting down the enemy left and right with his sword. It is a much more difficult fight, but the frigate emerges victorious.

That night the captain and crew are celebrating with rum when one curious deckhand pipes up, "Cap'n, how come you always wear a red shirt when you fight?"

The captain replies, "In a battle, morale is crucial. I wear a red shirt so that nobody can see I am hurt and bleeding, and you lot can keep fighting bravely."

The crew is impressed by the captain's wisdom and the carousing continues.

The next day the lookout spots an entire pirate fleet. A veritable armada of well armed and bloodthirsty pirates bore down on the Navy frigate. Surely they will give no quarter to the ship that captured their friends. The crew looks to the captain for his usual commands.

"All hands on deck! Man the guns and load chain shot! Full sails! And bring me my brown pants!"
