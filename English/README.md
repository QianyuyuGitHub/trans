比如说喜欢一个东西土著会说I dig而不是I like；高兴时土著会说I’m stoked而不是I’m excited；饿了土著会说I need grub而不是I need food（高级土著会说I need sustenance）；要呕吐了土著会说I’m gonna barf而不是I’m gonna puke（高级土著会说I’m gonna regurgitate）。其实括号里是开玩笑的，高级土著们不会那么说。

俩句型：So…I guess this is a good bye.I was wondering if you wanted to…

break a leg 现在已经通俗为好运，不止可以用在演出，平时朋友面试 比赛 都可以这么说～  
hold water的用法：这个观点缺乏理论/数据支撑，可以说 His opinion doesn't hold water  
一石二鸟应该不能用“two birds”，还是建议说完整：kill two birds with one stone.  
那个“get out of town”和语境有关，不建议代替所有的“我勒个去”哦  
for sb's sake不指“为了谁好”，而是“因为谁的原因”，有时根据语境会直指“为谁好”，但日常用的话建议改为“for sb's good sake”  
“get a crush on"主要指我喜欢上谁了，get强调瞬间动作，如 此时她的温柔让我喜欢上她了，如果是指暗恋，建议改成“have a crush on”  
lay off him和语境有关，有时lay off可以理解为解雇/强制休息～    
into appearances理解成以貌取人也可以，但是本身不是个固定短语，是取了“into”代表看中 喜欢，例如you're so into him 你太迷恋他了，所以这里into appearances是指一个人看重外表，不一定以貌取人～


下面文思提到的“That's what she said”是我非常喜欢的短语。为了能让大家更好的理解这句话的精髓所在，给大家举几个例子。
"So to use this ATM machine, you should insert it in and pull it out quickly."   
"That's what she said.

""OMG, this sausage is so huge!"  
"That's what she said."

"It hurts a little but I can handle that."   
"That's what she said."

"It tastes like coconut."  
"That's what she said."

Buying burrito  
"I love it when they stuff it in as much as possible"  
"That's what she said"

"Let's take a 5-min break."  
"That's what she said."

That's what she said 直译就是 她(之前/当时)也是这么说的。当然这样似乎缺少一点关于“性”的幽妙之意。如果一定要找一个中文中对应的句子的话，或许可以说是“你妈昨晚也这么说”，但又稍嫌粗鲁直白，少了英语原文的委婉和调皮。我想来想去，要兼顾两者的话，把她翻成 “恩妹子也这么说过”或许更加接近英语原文.. 所以上文信雅达兼顾文化背景的翻译，可以是：

“那用这台自动取款机的话，你要插进去然后快速地抽出来  
”“恩妹子也这么说过。”

“我的妈呀，这火腿肠好粗大！”  
“恩妹子也这么说过。”

“有点疼不过我还行受得了。”  
“恩妹子也这么说过。”

“尝起来有椰子的味道。”  
“恩妹子也这么说过。”

买墨西哥玉米煎饼，类似于中国小摊上煎饼果子/鸡蛋摊饼卷一类的东西  
“我特别喜欢他们往里面塞很多东西，越满越好。”
“恩妹子也这么说过。”

“我们休息五分钟吧。”  
“恩妹子也这么说过。”


A: I just want to tell you that I love you   
B: New phone, who dis?

Me: God, let me pass my finals  
God: New phone, who dis?

转移话题，意思差不多是： 喂喂喂？风太大我听不到
